# Worldwide DND

Forked from latest Andor's Trail.

Sorry about the delay in any updates. I'm going this project alone and real life keeps getting in my way. This winter I was able to convert all the Stendhal maps to 32x32 tiles. This makes about 6000 to 7000 maps. I started work on my own editor also. I delved into the code and found that I will need to radically change the save files, to make all my models dynamic. Which means every object file will have to be changed, as will the loader files to accomidate new variables. Meaning any changes to AT will have to be hard coded into my files at every change in AT base code. Since the new update is still being played, I'm going to let that one shake the bugs out before I start radically changing code. Once I start down that rabbit hole, I'm at the point of no return, and AT gets left behind.

I've never played Stendhal, so the similarities will be coincidental. The game follows the storyline and world of my past Dungeons and Dragons characters. I'll open the game characters up, so you don't have to play Jasia. All the quests will be available to all characters, eventually. Characters will be able to own houses and businesses. There will be mini games scattered throughout the land. Max level will be at 101, then you can reroll to play another character and keep all the items, money, etc that you have collected. Skills are going to be guild and race specific, so you'll only see skills that you can learn. Some skills can be taught by NPC. With a world as large as this one, you won't run out of things to do, or kill. As you will be able to attack most NPC's, be careful who you kill, they may be needed for a quest later on. Because I'm randomizing my quests, it may be the crazy old woman, or the drunk outside the inn who has your quest clue.

I've got much work to do yet, I've story boarded many of my main quests now, and have many of the base items and reagents in json files already. I'll be busy this year, but winter is my slow season and I'll see what I can get finished by next year.
